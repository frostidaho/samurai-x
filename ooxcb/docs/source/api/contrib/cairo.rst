ooxcb.contrib.cairo
===================

.. module:: ooxcb.contrib.cairo
    
This module is a ctypes wrapper of the `cairo`_ library and
its xcb backend, with some modifications that make it
possible to use it with ooxcb.

The API is the same as the original C api, so you can use
the `cairo api documentation`_.

See `examples/cairo.py` for a little example how to use that module.
