                `stream`: stream-like object
                    The stream to read the list data from. That will
                    most likely be a :class:`ooxcb.memstream.MemoryInputStream`
                    but any other object offering a buffer interface
                    is allowed.
                `offset`: int
                    This argument is just used to calculate the size of the
                    list. At other places it is ignored, because the stream has
                    a builtin position pointer.
                `length`: int
                    Count of items the list contains
                `type`: a typestring or a class
                    Information about the list type.
                `size`: int
                    The size of one item; not necessarily required.

            There are three kinds of lists here:

             * If *type* is a string (a typecode), the list contains *length*
               elementar, homogenous items, each *size* bytes big.
             * Otherwise, if *size* is > 0, *type* has to be a class that
               is initiated for each element. Then, the `read` method is called
               on the resulting object, with the stream as first element.
               The object is required to read exactly *size* bytes.
             * Otherwise, *type* is also required to be a class and is
               instantiated, `read` is called, and then the `size` attribute
               is read. That's for dynamic objects.
               Now, if the type has a `pythonize_lazy` method defined, it
               will be called on the object. That's a convenience method, ie
               for strings. The user doesn't have to bother with
               :class:`xproto.Str` instances, it is just converted to a Python
               string lazily and on-the-fly.
