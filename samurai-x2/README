samurai-x2
==========

samurai-x2 is a work in progress window manager written in pure python.

Installing
----------

In order to run samurai-x, you'll need the following software installed:

* Python >= 2.5 (http://www.python.org)
* setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)
* ``libxcb`` and ``xcb-util`` (http://xcb.freedesktop.org)
* ``cairo`` with enabled xcb backend  (http://cairographics.org)
* ``librsvg`` (http://librsvg.sourceforge.net)

You can find distribution-specific installation notes in our
`Wiki <http://samurai-x.org/wiki/Installation>`__.

Then, as root, type the following to install samurai-x:

::

    python setup.py install

This will create two console scripts: ``sx-wm``, the
window manager, and ``sx-events``, an ``xev`` clone
written in Python using the samuraix.xcb module.

Using
-----

Just type ``sx-wm`` to launch the samurai-x2 window manager.
If you want it not to run on the current display, set its
``DISPLAY`` environment variable.

As an example,

::

    DISPLAY=:1 sx-wm

will launch samurai-x on display :1.

Configuring
-----------

At the moment, samurai-x is configured using python scripts.
You can read more about that in the file ``samuraix/defaultconfig.py``
in the samurai-x2 distribution.
