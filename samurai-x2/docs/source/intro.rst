What's samurai-x2?
------------------

samurai-x2 is a Python window manager with a focus on extensibility.
samurai-x2 is based on `ooxcb`_, a new X binding, originally developed
for samurai-x2. Since the plugin system makes use of Python eggs, samurai-x2
also depends on the Python `setuptools`_.

What was samurai-x1?
--------------------

samurai-x1 was a Python window manager by Dunk Fordyce based on a ctypes Xlib binding.
Working on samurai-x1 has been halted, it's replaced by samurai-x2 now.
However, you can find the old code in `our git repository <http://samurai-x.org/browser/samurai-x>`_.
