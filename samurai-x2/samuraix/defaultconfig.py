# Currently, the samurai-x configuration takes place in a python script.
# You have full access to all python modules in your configuration file,
# so be careful what you do here.

# When samurai-x is loaded, it will look for a file .samuraix in your
# home directory. If there is no such file, samurai-x will use the
# default configuration file which you read currently.

# We need some modules:
import samuraix.xcb.modifiers as mods
# samuraix.xcb.modifiers has some modifier constants you can use:
# MOD_MASK_1 to MOD_MASK_5, MOD_MASK_SHIFT, MOD_MASK_LOCK, MOD_MASK_CONTROL
# The `xmodmap` tool is always helpful.
import samuraix.xcb.keysymdef as keys
# You will most likely only use the XK_a to XK_z constants. 
from samuraix.actions import *

# The `config` variable has to be either a dictionary or
# a callable object that returns a dictionary.
config = {
    # Here we map modifiers + keys to an action.

        # This action takes a so-called `Subject` as first argument

    # window having the modifiers and the mouse button
