        Base class for Plugins. You should derive your plugin
        from it. Every plugin is required to have a key describing its
        task. For example, the sx-simpledeco plugin has the
        'decoration' key. There are just a few constant plugin
        keys, so you are relatively free to use any key you like.
        Reserved keys are 'desktops' (there has to be a desktops plugin
        loaded, otherwise samurai-x2 will quit), ...

        .. data:: key

            The plugin key, usually a string

        :todo: complete the list of reserved keys.
