"""
    With sx-bind, you can bind keystrokes to actions.
    Its plugin key is "bind".

    Dependencies
    ------------

    sx-bind depends on :ref:`sx-actions`.

    Provided Parameters
    -------------------

    There is just one parameter that sx-bind provides in its parameter dictionary:
    'screen' is the :class:`samuraix.screen.Screen` object the keystroke was pressed
    on.

    Configuration
    -------------

    .. attribute:: bind.keys

        A dictionary connecting :ref:`keystrokes` to action lines.

        Example::

            'bind.keys': {
                    'Meta+n': 'desktops.cycle offset=1',
                    'Meta+p': 'desktops.cycle offset=-1',
                    'Meta+c': 'desktops.cycle_clients',
                    'Meta+d': 'log message="pressed d"',
                    'Meta+Q': 'quit',
                    'Ctrl+R': 'restart',
                    'Meta+L': 'layoutmgr.cycle',
            }

    .. _keystrokes:

    Keystrokes
    ----------

    A keystroke describes a combination of modifier keys and one normal key pressed.
    They are joined together by a "+" char. The modifiers are case-insensitive,
    the key is not.

    Valid modifier names are: 'alt', 'numlock', 'meta', 'altgr', 'shift', 'lock',
    'ctrl', 'control', 'mod1', 'mod2', 'mod3', 'mod4', 'mod5'. 

    The valid key values are listed in the :mod:`ooxcb documentation <ooxcb.keysymdef>`.

    Examples::

        # the following three keystrokes are equal
        Meta+n
        META+n
        mEtA+n
        # some more examples
        SHIFT+metA+0
        Ctrl+alt+Delete
