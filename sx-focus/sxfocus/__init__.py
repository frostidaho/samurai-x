    sx-focus is a plugin that ... urm ... what does it do? :]

    Configuration
    -------------

    .. attribute:: focus.style

        The focus style to use.

        There are several focus styles available:

        `click` (default)
            click in a window to focus and raise
        `sloppy`
            move the pointer into a window to focus
        `sloppy-autoraise`
            same as `sloppy`, but focused windows are raised automatically
