xpyb-ctypes
===========

xpyb-ctypes is a port of the `X python binding`_ to ctypes.
Much of it is an 1:1 port, but some changed. It is possible that
code for xpyb will run unchanged on xpyb-ctypes, but not 
guaranteed.

Many of the files in xcb/ are auto-generated using the `py_client`
script (from xpyb, with minor modifications).

As xpyb seems to be MIT/X11-licensed (please correct me if that's
wrong), xpyb-ctypes is MIT-licensed, too.

Thanks to xpyb!
